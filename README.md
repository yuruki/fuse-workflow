Real World Enterprise Workflow for Red Hat JBoss Fuse
=====================================================

Continuous Integration and its ambitious sibling, Continuous Deployment, have common goals: enable an organization to move changes from developer's workspace to production quickly and easily while ensuring quality and allowing rollbacks in case of trouble.

The goal is clear but to get there one must navigate a maze of choices and cross a desert of iteration. I will present you the results of one such journey.

In this session you'll learn how to set up an automated workflow for Red Hat JBoss Fuse which:
* is suited for a small DevOps team.
* is based on Fuse's Git features.
* manages both Fuse's and your bundle's configuration across dev, test, and production environments.
